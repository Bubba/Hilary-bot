 Well, first of all, it's great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future.
 I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight yearsand to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.
And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together.
 We faced 9/11.
 We worked hard to rebuild New York.
 I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced.
 We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.
And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.
  And that is — that is exactly what I want to do as your president.
 We will celebrate our diversity.
 We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America.
 That is what my campaign is about.

 Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified.
 I've been called a lot of things in my life.
 That was a first.
 And then he did say that he had to question my judgment.
  So, look, we have disagreements on policy.
 There's no doubt about it.
 But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the "New York Daily News," talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks.
I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.

 Well, make — make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama.
 President Obama had a super PAC when he ran.
 President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.
 And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulationson Wall Street in many a year.

 Absolutely.
 You know, this is what I've saying for the past year.
I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd-Frank.
 I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken.
 I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.
There are two sections there.
Let's look at what is at stake here.
 We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again.
 I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York.
 We've got to execute under it.
 So, you're right.
 I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry.
 Absolutely.

 Dana, you know — I love being in Brooklyn.
 Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.
 Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.
 That has to be the judgement of the regulators.
But, there's another element to this.
 I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.

  It is important — it's always important.
 It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight.
 I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.
I called them out on their mortgage behavior.
 I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code.
That is the law.
 Now, this is our ninth debate.
 In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law.
 You don't just say, go break them up.
 You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.

 We've got to include the shadow banking sector.
 You know, first of all — first of all, there isn't an issue.
 When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks.
I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.
Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture.
 It was a giant insurance company, AIG.
 It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers.
 It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.

 I have said, look, there are certain — there are certain expectations when you run for president.
 This is a new one.
 And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it — because there are speeches for money on the other side.
 I know that.
But I will tell you this, there is — there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go — you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns.
 And I've released 30 years of tax returns.
 And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.

 Right.
 Right.
 You know, let's set the same standard for everybody.
 When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns.
 Everybody does it, and then we move forward.

 Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.
 Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.
 Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach.
 And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing.
 I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.
I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business.
 And that's exactly what I will do.
When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.
So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting — more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America.
 And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.
I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened

 in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.

 Well, of course I would.
 And I have supportedI have supported the fight for 15.
 I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15.
 I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage.
 I always have.
 I supported that when I was in the Senate.

 But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York.
50 upstate then to $15.

 It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.

 Thank you very much.
 Thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 All right.
 I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15.
 I also — I supported the $15 effort in L.
 I supported in Seattle.
 I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.
The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.
 I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.
Going from $7.
25 to $12 is a huge difference.
 Thirty-five million people will get a raise.
 One in four working mothers will get a raise.
 I want to get something done.
 But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.
 All right.

 This is — this is a serious difference between us.
So, yes, we have a problem in America.
 We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby.
 We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.
  And what we have here is a big difference.
 Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times.
 He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.
I could not disagree more.
And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.
  That has this kind of special protection.
 We've got to hold Wall Street accountable

 Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.
But let me say this — in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.
 He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.
 He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.
 So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.
 Voting — he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.

 Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.
This is a — this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.
What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City.
 New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.

 Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.
 And you mentioned some of them.
 The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.
  And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.
On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.
So we have a problem.
 And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.
So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.
So that's how I see it.
 And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.

 It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well.
 Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said.
 I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address.
 And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York.
 We have got to help more kids get off to a good start.

 Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.
But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried — I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.
 And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.
So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.
 Best we can tell from the reports that are done.
But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.
 And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.

 Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.
 Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.
  I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.
 You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment

  And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism
 He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.
  And, you know, I am getting a little bit — I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.
 Now, it's easy — it's easy to diagnose the problem.

 And  
And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.
 So we did say natural gas is a bridge.
 We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.
That's why I've set big goals.
 I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.

 You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.
 I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis.

 Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise.
 And here's what we did.
We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.
I was very proud of that.
We also worked to help them set up their government.
 We sent a lot of American experts there.
 We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.
 We need to be working with European and Arab partners

The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government.
 And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them
 with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.
The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government.
 And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them
 Yes, well, III — I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.
Senator sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.

Senator sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.
 We went to the United Nations — yes, he did.
 We went to the United Nations Security Council.
 We got support from the Security Council.
 And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.
This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them.
 And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.
 We went to the United Nations — yes, he did.

 Well, that isn't
 Well, that isn't
 There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator.
 So, yes, it was unanimous.
 That's exactly right, including you.
And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.
 The decision was the president's.
 Did I do the due diligence? Did I talk to everybody I could talk to? Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president? Yes, I did.
But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.
 And the president made that decision.
 And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.

 Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.
 Now, that's how it works.
 People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.
 So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.

 I support our continuing involvement in NATO.
 And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.
But there's a larger question here.
 NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.
 So
 I support our continuing involvement in NATO.

 So
 I will stay in NATO.
 I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support.
 Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan.
 They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.
 That meant a lot.
And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening.
 With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.

 I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.
 I did it in concert with  President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet.
  They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.
So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you.
 You have a right to defend yourself.
 And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war.

  just let me finish.
 The rights and the autonomy that they deserve.
 And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.

 And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.
 I will certainly be willing to answer it.
 It would be great — remember, Israel left Gaza.
So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.

 Well, if I — I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it.
 And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.
There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me.
 Three long meetings.
 And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.
I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.

  you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders.

 Well, again — again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years.
 And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.
And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable.
 There's no doubt about that.
But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plansare actually going to work.
 And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out — remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years.
 He put out another plan.
 People have been analyzing the new plan.
 And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals.
The same for free college.
 The free college offer — you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print.
 You read the fine print, and here's what it says.

 Well
 We have — we have a difference of opinion.
 We both want to get to universal health care coverage.
 I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies.
  And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress.
 So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody

  let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care.
 That is one way.
 If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.
But there are other ways.
 We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people.
 We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.
But here's the real issue, because I — I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it.
 I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security.
 I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.
But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now.
 And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.
And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security

 You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V.
 Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned.
And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake.
 We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth.
 We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.
 We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished.
 And we are never asked about this.
And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction.
 I don't think it's a distraction.

 Let us talk about where we are in this race.
 I've gotten more votes than anybody running.
6 million at the last count.
 That is 2.
3 million more than Senator Sanders.
  And it is 1.
4 million more than Donald Trump.
 I think you have to look at the facts.
 And, the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running.

 And, I want to say — I also want to say that I do — I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process.
 I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders.
 We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.
But, let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed

 I think it's — I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates.
And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri.
  And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter.
So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday.
 I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California.
 And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention

 Thank you.
 I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator.
 You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we've had in our state in 2006.
 During those years, we worked closely together.
We took on the challenges of 9/11 together.
 We got the money to rebuild New York.
 We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors.
  We worked to create jobs — despite the disastrous policies of George W.
 Bush — across New York.
 And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.
You know, of course we have economic barriers.
 I've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life.
  We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.
So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday.
 I'll work my heart out for you again.
 We'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America.
  That's what we'll do together.
 Thank you, New York.

 Well, first of all, it's great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future.
 I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight yearsand to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.
And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together.
 We faced 9/11.
 We worked hard to rebuild New York.
 I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced.
 We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.
And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.
  And that is — that is exactly what I want to do as your president.
 We will celebrate our diversity.
 We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America.
 That is what my campaign is about.

 Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified.
 I've been called a lot of things in my life.
 That was a first.
 And then he did say that he had to question my judgment.
  So, look, we have disagreements on policy.
 There's no doubt about it.
 But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the "New York Daily News," talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks.
I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.

 Well, make — make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama.
 President Obama had a super PAC when he ran.
 President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.
 And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulationson Wall Street in many a year.

 Absolutely.
 You know, this is what I've saying for the past year.
I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd-Frank.
 I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken.
 I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.
There are two sections there.
Let's look at what is at stake here.
 We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again.
 I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York.
 We've got to execute under it.
 So, you're right.
 I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry.
 Absolutely.

 I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry.
 Dana, you know — I love being in Brooklyn.
 Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.
 Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.
 That has to be the judgement of the regulators.
But, there's another element to this.
 I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.

  It is important — it's always important.
 It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight.
 I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.
I called them out on their mortgage behavior.
 I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code.
That is the law.
 Now, this is our ninth debate.
 In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law.
 You don't just say, go break them up.
 You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.

 We've got to include the shadow banking sector.
 You know, first of all — first of all, there isn't an issue.
 When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks.
I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.
Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture.
 It was a giant insurance company, AIG.
 It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers.
 It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.

 I have said, look, there are certain — there are certain expectations when you run for president.
 This is a new one.
 And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it — because there are speeches for money on the other side.
 I know that.
But I will tell you this, there is — there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go — you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns.
 And I've released 30 years of tax returns.
 And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.

 Right.
 Right.
 You know, let's set the same standard for everybody.
 When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns.
 Everybody does it, and then we move forward.

 Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.
 Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.
 Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach.
 And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing.
 I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.
I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business.
 And that's exactly what I will do.
When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.
So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting — more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America.
 And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.
I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened

 in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.

 Well, of course I would.
 And I have supportedI have supported the fight for 15.
 I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15.
 I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage.
 I always have.
 I supported that when I was in the Senate.

 But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York.
50 upstate then to $15.

 It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.

 Thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 Thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 All right.
 I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15.
 I also — I supported the $15 effort in L.
 I supported in Seattle.
 I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.
The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.
 I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.
Going from $7.
25 to $12 is a huge difference.
 Thirty-five million people will get a raise.
 One in four working mothers will get a raise.
 I want to get something done.
 But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.

 This is — this is a serious difference between us.
So, yes, we have a problem in America.
 We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby.
 We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.
  And what we have here is a big difference.
 Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times.
 He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.
I could not disagree more.
And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.
  That has this kind of special protection.
 We've got to hold Wall Street accountable

 Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.
But let me say this — in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.
 He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.
 He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.
 So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.
 Voting — he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.

 Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.
This is a — this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.
What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City.
 New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.

 Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.
 And you mentioned some of them.
 The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.
  And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.
On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.
So we have a problem.
 And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.
So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.
So that's how I see it.
 And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.

 It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well.
 Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said.
 I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address.
 And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York.
 We have got to help more kids get off to a good start.

 Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.
But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried — I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.
 And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.
So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.
 Best we can tell from the reports that are done.
But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.
 And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.

 Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.
 Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.
  I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.
 You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment

  And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism
 He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.
  And, you know, I am getting a little bit — I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.
 Now, it's easy — it's easy to diagnose the problem.
 And

 And  
And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.
 So we did say natural gas is a bridge.
 We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.
That's why I've set big goals.
 I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.

 You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.
 I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis.

 Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise.
 And here's what we did.
We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.
I was very proud of that.
We also worked to help them set up their government.
 We sent a lot of American experts there.
 We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.
 We need to be working with European and Arab partners

 Yes, well, III — I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.
Senator sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.

 We went to the United Nations — yes, he did.
 We went to the United Nations Security Council.
 We got support from the Security Council.
 And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.
This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them.
 And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.
 We went to the United Nations — yes, he did.

 Well, that isn't
 There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator.
 So, yes, it was unanimous.
 That's exactly right, including you.
And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.
 The decision was the president's.
 Did I do the due diligence? Did I talk to everybody I could talk to? Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president? Yes, I did.
But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.
 And the president made that decision.
 And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.

 Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.
 Now, that's how it works.
 People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.
 So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.

 I support our continuing involvement in NATO.
 And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.
But there's a larger question here.
 NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.
 So

 So
 I will stay in NATO.
 I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support.
 Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan.
 They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.
 That meant a lot.
And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening.
 With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.

 I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.
 I did it in concert with  President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet.
  They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.
So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you.
 You have a right to defend yourself.
 And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war.
 I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.
 I did it in concert with  President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet.
  They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.
So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you.
 You have a right to defend yourself.
 And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war.
  just let me finish.
 The rights and the autonomy that they deserve.
 And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.

 And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.
 I will certainly be willing to answer it.
 It would be great — remember, Israel left Gaza.
So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.

 Well, if I — I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it.
 And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.
There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me.
 Three long meetings.
 And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.
I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.

  you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders.

 Well, again — again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years.
 And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.
And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable.
 There's no doubt about that.
But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plansare actually going to work.
 And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out — remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years.
 He put out another plan.
 People have been analyzing the new plan.
 And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals.
The same for free college.
 The free college offer — you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print.
 You read the fine print, and here's what it says.

 Well
 We have — we have a difference of opinion.
 We both want to get to universal health care coverage.
 I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies.
  And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress.
 So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody

  let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care.
 That is one way.
 If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.
But there are other ways.
 We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people.
 We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.
But here's the real issue, because I — I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it.
 I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security.
 I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.
But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now.
 And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.
And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security

 You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V.
 Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned.
And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake.
 We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth.
 We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.
 We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished.
 And we are never asked about this.
And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction.
 I don't think it's a distraction.

 I've gotten more votes than anybody running.
6 million at the last count.
 That is 2.
3 million more than Senator Sanders.
  And it is 1.
4 million more than Donald Trump.
 I think you have to look at the facts.
 And, the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running.

 And, I want to say — I also want to say that I do — I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process.
 I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders.
 We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.
But, let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed

 I think it's — I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates.
And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri.
  And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter.
So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday.
 I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California.
 And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention

 Thank you.
 I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator.
 You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we've had in our state in 2006.
 During those years, we worked closely together.
We took on the challenges of 9/11 together.
 We got the money to rebuild New York.
 We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors.
  We worked to create jobs — despite the disastrous policies of George W.
 Bush — across New York.
 And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.
You know, of course we have economic barriers.
 I've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life.
  We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.
So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday.
 I'll work my heart out for you again.
 We'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America.
  That's what we'll do together.
 Thank you, New York.

   Well Nikki, it's a very fair question.
Your government at all levels have let you and your children and the people of Flint down.
 So I think that there are there several things.
 All the repair work that is being done — and Mayor Weaver program that we support to begin to help train people in Flint to be able to do this work to distribute the water.
 Everything that is done has to be triple checked to regain your trust and to hold those who are responsible for fixing the pipes and delivering the clean water which has you said, you bathe in it and drink it and wash food in it.
 You do everything with it.
Every one of us should have to run through in our minds how we use water every single day to understand the pressures and the real pain that families are going through.
 So I will make sure as President that I double and triple check.
 I will work with elected officials who I trust like your mayor and like your senators and member of Congress so that we can assure you that when it's fixed, you can trust it.
 You deserve nothing less.

 Well, I support what President Obama is doing.
 He called for and got accountability from the officials at the EPA to make sure the state is doing its job.
 He expanded Medicaid for helping kids particularly to get the health care they need.
 He is also ordered that there be a Head Start program.
 I support that.
 I would do even more of that.
 As president, what we were able to put together was a beginning.
 As president, I would concentrate resources on the city for economic development for more jobs as we fix the water and provide the health and education, interventions that children need.

 I would certainly be launching an investigation.
 I think there is one.
So I would have a full investigation, determine who knew what, when.
 How far up it went, I don't know.
 But as far as it goes, they should be relieved, because they failed this city.
But let me just add this, Anderson.
 We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate.
 We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint.

 I want to go further though.
 I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems, it's also in soil, and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes.
So, I want to do exactly what you said.
We were making progress on this in the 1990's.

 We're going to get rid of it.

 Well, that's going to be up to the legal system, Don.
 I mean, I can't standing here — I don't have all the facts, but people should be held accountable wherever that leads.
 There has to be an absolute accountability, and I will support whatever the outcome of those investigations are.

 Well, I think because throughout my public career I have been evening the odds for people in every way that I could.
 I started out with the Children's Defense Fund, I worked throughout my time as a young lawyer as a person, an activist.
 Certainly, in Arkansas, then in the White House, to try to fix problems wherever I saw them.
So, when I heard about it I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on.
 It was almost unbelievable.
 So, I have put together resources from the private and philanthropic communities to help provide a bridge because you've got to get the federal money, you've got to get the state money, but I'm going to do everything I can.
 And, I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis in whatever capacity I am.
And, if I'm president, it will always be a priority for action from me.

 Let me talk about the carrots.
 We're going to have a very clear set of proposals and incentives for manufacturing so that we change the way that companies think about making investments again in America.
 I have a comprehensive manufacturing plan that I will be implementing.
" That will put a lot of people to work.
We need to do more to help create clean energy as a source of good jobs but I am also going to go after companies.
 You know, when a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving and they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits.
I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin.
 They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe.
 We are going to stop this kind of job exporting and we are going to start importing and growing jobs again in our country.

 Well — well, I'll tell you something else that Senator Sanders was against.
 He was against the auto bailout.
 In January of 2009, President-Elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout.
The money was there, and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and four million jobs, and to begin the restructuring.
 We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time.
 I voted to save the auto industry.
 He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry.
 I think that is a pretty big difference.

 If you're gonna talk, tell the whole story, Senator Sanders.
 If you're gonna talk, tell the whole story, Senator Sanders.
 I will.
 I will.
 OK, so.
 OK, so.
 Well, if I — if I could.
 It was called CAFTA.
 I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it.
 I oppose it.
 The Bush administration negotiated the deal.
But was the auto bailout money in it — the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? Yes, it was.

 Well, all I can say is that given the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing, I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do.
He sent a letter, an authorized letter, asking us to support that to save the auto industry.
 Yes, were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? That's true.
 But when it came down to it, you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it.
 I voted to save the auto industry.
 And I am very glad that I did.

He sent a letter, an authorized letter, asking us to support that to save the auto industry.
 Yes, were there things in it that you and I would not have necessarily wanted? That's true.
 But when it came down to it, you were either for saving the auto industry or you were against it.
 I voted to save the auto industry.
 And I am very glad that I did.
 And I have said and I will say again, I will be happy to release anything I have as long as everybody else does too, because what really is behind that question, Republicans and Democrats, is where I can stand up to Wall Street.
Well, let's have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change.
 I went to Wall Street when I was a United States senator.
 I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures.
 I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen.
 I have a record.
And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the Great Depression with the Dodd-Frank regulations.

There had been a net increase of 54,000 manufacturing jobs.
 There had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall.
And, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in Michigan was through something called the Export-Import Bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world.
Senator Sanders opposes that.
 I think we're in a race for exports.
 I think China, Germany, everybody else supports their businesses.
 Here in Michigan there's been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses.
 I want to do everything I can for us to compete and win in the global economy.

 When I traveled around the world on you behalf as Secretary of State and went to 112 countries, one thing I saw everywhere was how European and Asian countries were supporting their companies back in their countries, to be able to make sales and contracts in a lot of the rest of the world.
 In fact, without the export-import bank, supporting businesses of all sizes — I believe more jobs would be lost here at home and more jobs literally would be exported.
 Instead of exporting products, we would be exporting jobs.
I just believe that Senator Sanders took that lonely position because most of us who saw the results — I saw it as a senator from New York.
 Your Senators saw it here in Michigan.
 They can give you the names of 240 companies in Michigan that have been helped.
There is a company in Levonia being helped, there are companies all over this state.

 There two big plane manufacturers in the world, there's Airbus and Boeing.
 Airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world.
I did go in many places around the world to sell American products because the alternatives were usually European, Asian, primarily Chinese products.
 So yes, Boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support.

 Well, first of all I am looking at your daughter and I'm very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery.
 But it never should have happened.
I think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms.
 The Brady Bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward.
But the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what's called the Charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in Charleston did.
 They can be held accountable.
And then I do think we have got to have a public.

 And, I think it's fair to say we did because back then there was an outcry over the rising crime rate, and people from all communities were asking that action be taken.
Now, my husband said at the NAACP last summer that it solved some problems, but it created other problems, and I agree.
 So, we've got to do a bunch of things.
On the criminal justice side, look, we've got to have better policing.
And, when it comes to incarceration.

 Let me go answer Mr.
 Mcghee's question because I think it's a profound one.
 It was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear Dr.
 King speak in Chicago when I was about 14 years old.
 That got me thinking about what I needed to do to try to fulfill my faith.
When I was in law school, I had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named Mary Right Adelman, who worked with Dr.
 King who was the first African-American woman who passed the Mississippi bar.
 So I got law students a Civil Rights Research Council Grant.
The first thing she did was send me to look at South Carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails.
 The second thing she did was to send me to Alabama to investigate segregated academies.
 So from that moment until today, I am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the Children's Defense Fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything I can to address systemic racism.

 And I've gotten to know them.
 I've listened to them.
 And it has been incredibly humbling because I can't pretend to have the experience that you have had and others have had.
 But I will do everything that I possibly can to not only do the best to understand and to empathize, but to tear down the barriers of systemic racism that are in the criminal justice system, in the employment system, in the education and health care system.

 Mcgee, is, you know, really, ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind.
And I know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in Detroit that have mold and rodents in them.
 I saw that in South Carolina.
 So what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child.
That's why I believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful.

 Well, once again, if we're going to argue about the '90s, let's try to get the facts straight.
 Bush, by Republican governors.
 And I have a very clear set of ideas about what should be done to try to provide more support, including trying to cut poverty in half in the next years.
But if we are going to talk about the '90s, let's talk about 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody.
 The median African- American income went up 33 percent at the end of the '90s and we lifted more people out of poverty than at any other time in recent history.
So we were on the right path.
 More jobs, rising incomes.

 Mrs.
 Kim, here is what I would do as president.
 Number three, I want to set-up inside the Department of Education, for want of a better term, kind of an education SWAT team, if you will.
 Where we've got qualified people, teachers, principals, maybe folks who are retired, maybe folks who are active, but all of whom are willing to come and help.
 When Detroit gets back their schools, they should have all the help they can get to be able to get teachers in the classroom, to be able to find spaces while schools are being repaired.
 And, I also would look at how we could through the federal government support more teachers because we're going to have a teacher shortage in some of the hardest to teach districts.

 We need to eliminate the criticism.
You know, teachers do so much good, they are often working under most difficult circumstances.
 So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it.
 I will be a good partner to make sure that whatever I can do as president, I will do to support the teachers of our country.

 Well, there's no doubt, we have an enormous backlog of infrastructure repairs.
 I want to go further.
I want to put 250 billion dollars additional, on top of what Congress has done.
 That gets us to a half a billion.
 I want to start a National Infrastructure Bank.
 I want to capitalize it with 25 billion that I believe will leverage 10 times that, that's another 250 billion.
So I'm trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but there's no doubt, we have to do more on our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports.
 And as we've talked in the beginning here, under our ground, our water systems, our sewer systems.
 We have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work, I think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it.

 Well, first, let me say I think I have the most comprehensive plan to combat climate change.
 It sets some very big goals, a half billion more solar panels deployed by the end of my first term, if I'm so fortunate to be president.
 And enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term.
What I am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be.
 I worked with President Obama during the four years I was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on China and India and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in Paris.
So I am committed to and focused on how we make that transition.
 I am going to set the goals.
 I will push everybody as hard as I can to achieve those goals.
 We will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that.

 And that is one of the many reasons we must all support President Obama's right to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia and demand that the Senate hold hearings and a vote on that successor because there are so many issues at stake.

 Well, let me start by saying that the last time I checked as of last night, Donald Trump had received 3.
6 million votes, which is a good number.
 And there is only one candidate in either party who has more votes than him and that's me.
 And, I am building a broad, diverse coalition across our country.
 I'm very excited by the support we're receiving.
 So, I will look forward to engaging him because, you know, I don't think we need to make America great again.
 America didn't stop being great, we have to make it whole again.
And, if I'm fortunate enough to be the nominee that's exactly what I will do.

 Well, I have been several times in your services and have joined in those prayers and have also been privileged to lead them in some settings.
 I pray very specifically for people whom I know by name.
I pray for the will of God to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it.
 I have said many times that, you know, I am a praying person, and if I haven't been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one.
 Because it's very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.
So I do pray for people in authority.
 I try to think about what they are going through, even when I disagree with them.
 Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic.
 I don't always succeed.
 I will tell you that.
So I pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength and I need that support.
 And especially when you are in the position that I'm in and that Senator Sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but I would argue in the world.
I think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if you're fortunate enough, to that holding of office and that's what I will try to do.

 Well, I'm running for president to do my very best to knock down every barrier that stands in the way of America realizing its potential and every American having a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
 We have a lot of work to do.
 We have economic barriers.
 That's why I've laid out plans for more good jobs with rising incomes.
 We have barriers that stand in the way of quality health care.
 That's why I will build on the Affordable Care Act.
We have barriers to education.
 That's why I want to start early and provide debt-free tuition, and deal with student debt so it is no longer the burden that weighs down so many young Americans.
So I'm asking for your support in the primary here in Michigan on Tuesday.
 I'm asking for it, and I will do whatever I can as the Democratic nominee to run a campaign you'll be proud of.
I don't intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, to set big goals, to make it clear that America's best days can be and are ahead of us.

 I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
 And for good cause.
 Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
 But I want to go further.
 Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
 Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
 I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
 That will be my mission as president.
 And I think together we will make progress.

 Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans — let's take healthcare for example.
 This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.

 I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
  And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment — namely the Affordable Care Act — is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
 We are at 90 percent coverage.
 We have to get the remaining 10.
 I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
 But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
 If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
 The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.

 Well, let me just — let me just say, once again.
that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
 I believe we are on the path to doing that.
 The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
 We are not France.
 We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
 So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
 We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.

 But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family? In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
 I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
 There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
 I'm aware of that.

 I will put a price tag.
 My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
 I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
 And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
 But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.

 You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
 And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
 We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
 And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
 I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.

 Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
 I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
 And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
 So I'm going to keep making that case.
 I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
 But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
 I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
 That's what I'm working towards.

 That's what I'm working towards.
 Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
 But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
 That's what I've always stood for.
 I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
 So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.

 I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander-in-chief.
  And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
 And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
 So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.

 His family certainly believes that.
 And so do I.
 So we have work to do.
 There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
 President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
 I have fully endorsed those.
But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
 But, I would also add this.
 So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.

 I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
 We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
 I think President Obama has set a great example.
 I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
 Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
 We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
 Obama's work with young women.
 But, we can't rest.
 We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
 So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.

 Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
 This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
 And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
 You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice? And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
 I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has — the 10-20-30 proposal — to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
 And you know what? If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
 And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.

 I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
 I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
 I am against the raids.
 We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
 I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
 Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
 I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
 I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
 Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
 Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
 And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
 And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.

 Two quick responses.
 I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
 And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
 And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
 And I was proud to stand with him and support it.

 So we have a disagreement on this.
 I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
 So we have a disagreement on this.

 I think — I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
 We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
 I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
 First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
 I want to take care of women.
 And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
 So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
 But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.

 I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the — raising the cap would apply to passive income.

 I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the — raising the cap would apply to passive income.
 Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
 I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
 So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
 We're going to end up in the same place.
 We're going to get more revenue.
 I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.

 I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
 They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
 Let's talk about our campaigns.
 I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
 So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
 I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
 That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
 I think that is the real key here.
 We both have a lot of small donors.
 The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
 It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
 We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.

 We are mixing apples and oranges.
 My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
 I'm very proud.
 That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
 But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
 I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
 Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
 He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
 So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.

 I think that's a major accomplishment.
 I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
 It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
 It was a big insurance company, AIG.
 It was Countrywide Mortgage.
 My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
 And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
 It goes in the right direction.
 We have Dodd-Frank.
 We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
 But let's not kid ourselves.
 As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
 I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these.

 Absolutely.
 There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
 I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
 And that's what I intend to do.
 Absolutely.

 Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
 So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
 That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
 We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
 We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
 And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
 They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
 Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
 We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
 But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
 And we need to do that throughout the country.
 But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
 They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
 So when somebody like Donald Trump and others.
 And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
 I know how to do that.
 So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.

 If I could just respond.
 Two points.
 One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
 He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
 I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
 It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
 And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
 As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
 I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
 If I could just respond.
 Two points.
 One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
 He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
 I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.

 You did support a U.
 Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
 I looked at the intelligence.
 I got the briefings.
 I recommended that the president go forward.
 It was a hard choice.
 And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
 So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
 I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
 And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.

 Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.

 That's fine.
 That's fine.
  You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
 I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.

 And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.

 Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
 The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
 You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
 But I would add this.
 You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
 We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
 Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
 So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
 So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
 So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.

 Well, I respectfully disagree.
 I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
 Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
 They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
 We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.

 That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.

 Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
 And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
 With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.
, as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
 in particular.
 So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
 We have to stand with them.
 We have to provide financial support to them.
 We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
 And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.

 I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
But I want to — I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
 You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president.
who got us out of that.
put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
 And it is a — the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
 I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.

 As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
 I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
 But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.

 We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
 But here's the point I want to make tonight.
 And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before.
 Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? You're right.
